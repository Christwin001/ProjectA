To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run the project locally

•⁠  ⁠[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version: >=18.x)
•⁠  ⁠[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Usage

1.⁠ ⁠Fork the repo, then clone it using the following command (remember to replace the url with the url from your forked repo)

    ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Go to the project folder

   ⁠ 
   cd ProjectA
    ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠Set up Node if your Node version does not meet the project's requirements, as instructed by the documentation., "nvm" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

 
   nvm use
    ⁠

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   nvm install && nvm use
    ⁠

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
